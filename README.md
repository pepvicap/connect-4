# Connect 4!

This project is a web-based implementation of the classic game "Connect 4". It is built using React.js and allows two players to play the game on the same device. Players take turns dropping colored discs into the board. The first player to get four of their colored discs in a row wins the game. The game also includes a button to reset the game or reset the wins count for each player. The game is saved in local storage, so you can refresh the page or come back later and pick up where you left off.
